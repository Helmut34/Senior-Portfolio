**Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, 


  One of my biggest challenges was not just an academic but also a personal struggle. Throughout my educational career, I would complete schoolwork and do well on tests, but I wasn’t truly learning the material. I excelled at math and did well on exams for every class, not because I deeply understood the concepts, but because I had strong pattern-recognition skills. Once a test was over, I would quickly forget everything.

  I only realized this when I began taking higher-level courses that required me to apply prior knowledge in new ways. Suddenly, I found myself struggling and at a disadvantage, I had to relearn materials which I should have already mastered. This was very discouraging at first, but ultimately taught me how to learn efficiently and sparked my love for learning.

**Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.**

A situation where I was exposed to peer work was a project I had to do for my Object-Oriented course. It was a mock-up team whose purpose was to plan, organize, and create a coding project. In our case, we decided to recreate the game Clue. Overall, the experience went well apart from a few mishaps. I would describe myself as very team-oriented, sometimes too much. I could improve in working without the team. I’m very used to working alone, so when I work in a team, I like to upkeep communication. This isn’t the case for everyone. Whenever a teammate can’t or won’t communicate back, it is a situation that I struggle with. It makes me lag behind in work, especially when each team member is supposed to be making a part of the project, and at the end, the project must connect.




**What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.**
I’d like a career that involved talking to people. When I first started Computer Science, I was very shut-in and didn’t enjoy having to communicate with other people. During the copious amount of hours I’ve committed to the degree, I’ve realized that I do enjoy talking to people. This wasn’t going to make me leave the field, so I did research and found jobs in the field that require intensive communication. These jobs include technology consultants, product managers, as well as some developer positions. These positions combine the fun of technical problem solving with strong communication teamwork, which makes them a perfect fit for me.



**What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.**





**What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.**
