## Project description

Map Algorithm that stores student's first name, lastname and maps it to an ID. 
Constranames Consist of:
A unique constant contiguus sequence of char values that contains a first and a last name;

Between each first and last name there is a space;

Only the 26 letters of the english algphabet are used;

In the algorithm every students name maps to a single nonnegative 32-bit integer.

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
cd ./project1
make run
```


## UI Design

No UI Design, this project is mainly to develop an algorithm that can accurately and quickly pass the given testcases. Complexity and Time information provided after running.
